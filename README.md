Ludum Dare 43 Theme: *Sacrifices Must be Made*

Set in a dystopian near-future, a nefarious tech company preys on the poor by selling the rights to their senses and cognitive abilities. Those who wish to sell their abilities must participate in a mind-bending series of puzzles to prove their aptitude.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish my game for this Ludum Dare. However, it was a great chance to test the [text-driven game framework](https://github.com/regal/regal) that I've been developing. **I plan to keep at this game once things are less busy, so follow the GitHub repo] if you're interested in staying updated!**

I've uploaded the game in its current state at the below. Feel free to play and give feedback! Have fun! :smiley:
